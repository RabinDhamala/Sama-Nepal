            <br>
            <p>To achieve inclusion we have created an <b>Inclusion Process </b>that we implement where we work.
                This Inclusion Process is divided into two scales: an Inclusion Process at the community level and an
                Inclusion Process at the school level. These two processes have been designed to establish easily
                replicable Inclusion practices throughout Nepal and in all situations, we work closely with parents,
                family and stakeholders.</p>

            <h2>Community Inclusion Process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>To make Inclusion sucessful we need several specialists to sense the different aspects of the children
                and better understand their needs. That is why, although our foccus areas are Inclusive Education and
                Inclusion, we also work in collaboration with available professionals and experts from various
                disciplines
                (doctor, therapist, psychologist, counsellor, special educator,...) and organizations.</p>
            <p>We focus our work in a <b>base school</b>, we offer secondary support in <b>other schools </b> around
                , as well as we coordinate and refer for rehabilitation, medical and healthcare services with several
                <b>partner organizations.</b></p>

                    <h3>BASE SCHOOL</h3>
                    <p>We work with one or more base school(s), in every working district, where our Inclusion
                        Facilitators with other experts offer intensive support.</p>

                    <h3>OTHER SCHOOLS</h3>

                        kinds of workshops and support. It is a secondary, need-based service.</p>

            <h2>School Inclusion Process</h2>
            <br>
            <p>All children are included in school and participate in different activities according to their possible
                participation.</p>
            <p> We follow 3 different Inclusion practices for all children in mainstream school based on their
                participation.</p>
