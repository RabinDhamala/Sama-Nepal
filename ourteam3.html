              my core responsibility is to assist in infrastructural modification to achieve accessibility. Being a
              spouse of a person with a disability has taught me a huge lesson that social attitude towards disability
              and lack of accessibility are the key reasons that limited ability of people with disability. I believe,
              people with disabilities are equally capable as people without disabilities, however, due to lack of
              accessibility causes them limited to access an education and social participation. I also believe,
              inclusive society is incomplete without participation of people with disabilities.
